# ML in plant diseases recognition

This project was my diploma work at Voronezh State University.
"Application of Machine learning methods for automatic plant deseases recognition".

Stack of technologies: Python 3, Tensorflow, Keras, sklearn. As main platform I used Google Colab because of it massive GPU boost.
Publication, based on this project, can be found here (Available only in Russian. Pages 71 - 79): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-O5i4aW98lDwe_oxeAnwp7ROYFnrXDGX/edit
